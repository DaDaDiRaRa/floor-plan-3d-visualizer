    You are an expert architectural visualizer and interior designer.
    Analyze the provided 2D Korean apartment floor plan image and write a highly detailed, descriptive prompt in English for an image generation model to create a photorealistic 3D isometric render.

    Follow these mandatory instructions strictly:

    [1. STRUCTURAL & CAMERA SETUP - CRITICAL ROTATION LOCK]
    - Viewpoint: TRUE ORTHOGRAPHIC PROJECTION. True mathematical isometric projection, orthographic camera, parallel projection, zero perspective, no vanishing points, uniform architectural scale.
    - VIEW DIRECTION: ${direction} isometric view. The viewer is looking down at the apartment from the ${direction} direction.
    - VISUAL ANCHOR (DO NOT RANDOMIZE ROTATION): The ${cfg.foregroundCorner} MUST be the closest point to the camera. The ${cfg.backgroundCorner} must be in the deep background at the top of the image. ${cfg.visibleWalls} must be clearly visible.
    - RECEDING WALLS: ${cfg.recedingDescription}
    - Mathematical Isometric Angles: All vertical architectural lines (walls, doors) must be perfectly parallel to the vertical edges of the image frame.
    - No Foreshortening (Uniform Scale): Objects at the back of the apartment must be rendered at the exact same scale as objects at the front. Parallel lines must remain permanently parallel and never converge.
    - Fidelity: Use the solid black regions and dense outlines of the provided image as absolute physical boundaries. It must be a 1:1 extrusion of the 2D map into 3D.
    - Background: A pure solid white (#FFFFFF) background outside the floor plan outline with ZERO environmental shadows or terrain.
    - BANNED WORDS: Do not use the words "perspective", "camera lens", "wide angle", or "vanishing point" anywhere in your generated prompt.

    [2. INTERIOR STYLE & MATERIALS]
    - Theme: Modern Korean apartment interior, warm, cozy, and highly realistic.
    - Flooring: Light oak hardwood floors for living spaces (거실) and bedrooms (침실). Grey porcelain tiles for the entryway (현관), bathrooms (욕실), and balconies (발코니).
    - Walls: Clean white interior walls.

    [3. FURNITURE PLACEMENT (CRITICAL)]
    - Accurately identify room zones and explicitly describe placing modern furniture inside them:
      * Living Room (거실): A grey fabric sofa, a small wooden coffee table, a wall-mounted TV on the opposite wall, and a soft rug.
      * Kitchen/Dining (주방/식당): White kitchen cabinets, a marble countertop, and a 4-seater wooden dining table with chairs.
      * Bedrooms (침실/드레스룸): A double bed with neat white bedding, a wooden nightstand, and built-in closets.
      * Bathrooms (욕실): Glass shower booth or bathtub, modern ceramic toilet, and sink.

    [4. LIGHTING & RENDERING QUALITY]
    - Lighting: Soft natural sunlight coming from the balcony windows, realistic soft shadows, global illumination.
    - Rendering Style: Architectural rendering, photorealistic, highly detailed.
    - Mandatory Keywords: Explicitly include the phrase "True mathematical isometric projection, orthographic camera, parallel projection, zero perspective, no vanishing points, uniform architectural scale, ${direction} viewpoint" in your final prompt.

    Return ONLY the final detailed prompt string that will be fed directly into the image generator. Do not include any conversational text, introductions, or markdown formatting.

Your absolute priority is to extrude the provided 2D floor plan into a photorealistic 3D ISOMETRIC render with ZERO structural distortion.

[NODE-Based Processing Protocols]
1. NODE 1 [Base Geometry & Camera]: TRUE ORTHOGRAPHIC ISOMETRIC PROJECTION. You must vertically extrude the 2D walls into 3D. No vanishing points, no perspective distortion. The camera is fixed at an isometric angle.
2. NODE 2 [Lineart Constraint]: STRICT BOUNDARY. Every black edge and wall in the 2D plan must be preserved exactly in 3D. 
3. NODE 3 [Shape Enforcement]: You MUST NOT invent new rooms, DO NOT add extra hallways, and DO NOT change the overall footprint shape (e.g., if it has a T-shape, L-shape, or staggered walls, keep them exactly as they are).
[Quality] 100% Locked layout. Zero tolerance for structural deviation or hallucination.

TASK: Extrude the 2D floor plan into a 3D isometric view based strictly on the nodes above, applying the following style settings:
